        "## Introduction <a id=\"section-one\"></a>\n",
        "The world has rapidly embraced e-commerce platforms, leading to a significant boom in online shopping. In recent times, an increasing number of people are taking advantage of the convenience of shopping from their homes. The rise in e-commerce platforms has resulted in a reduction in the number of middlemen, allowing goods to be offered at competitive prices with regular discounts.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the primary drawback of online shopping has been the lack of physical touch and inspection before purchasing a product. This is where the concept of leaving reviews acts as a savior. Reviews play a crucial role in helping potential customers make informed purchasing decisions. A typical review consists of a rating (usually out of 5), a title/summary, and the main body of the review.\n",
        "\n",
        "While it may seem that reviews are primarily beneficial for potential customers, they also hold significant importance for companies aiming to enhance their products and services through analysis. However, manually inspecting individual reviews can feel like a perpetual task. This is where Sentiment Analysis in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) can truly work wonders.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is sentiment analysis?\n",
        "Sentiment Analysis is a commonly used text classification tool in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that analyzes text and tries to detect the underlying sentiment. It's also known as opinion mining. Businesses can leverage this information to improve their products and services, as the sentiments are conveyed directly by the end consumers. E-commerce has made obtaining direct feedback from customers a breeze, as almost all online shopping websites allow dropping reviews. With Sentiment Analysis, customer feedback can be analyzed in bulk to improvise products and services for better customer satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Problem statement\n",
        "The objective of this research project is to explore and analyze customer reviews in the e-commerce domain using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The growing importance of customer reviews in the decision-making process of online shoppers has made sentiment analysis and opinion mining crucial for e-commerce businesses. By employing NLP methods on a large corpus of e-commerce reviews, this research aims to extract valuable insights, sentiment patterns, and consumer preferences to help businesses make data-driven decisions and improve customer satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives of Project\n",
        "This research aims to contribute to the field of NLP and help e-commerce businesses make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and overall performance."
